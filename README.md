# DSCI403-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

### This project works on the Python deep learning algorithm Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build a handwritten digit recognition model using the MNIST dataset.

#### 1. Employed the Python TensorFlow library to build a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model, defining all the layers that the model is going to have, compiling the model, and training it.

#### 2. Compared different parameter settings of the CNN to observe how they can affect the CNN's output.

###### Image Explanation: The larger model (number of kernels: 64, number of neurons: 1024) exhibits high accuracy and low loss on both the training and test sets. The larger model did not show any clear signs of overfitting, as the loss value did not exhibit a clear increase, and the accuracy did not show a clear decrease.
